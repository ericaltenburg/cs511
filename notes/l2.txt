Week 1 Lecture 2 - 9/2/20

- The field of concurrency was started by Dijkstra
- Concurrency: study of systems of interacting computer programs which share resources and run concurrently
	- "at the same time" not exactly at the same time, the OS scheduler switches apps
	- "interacting" exchange information and agree on certain things
		- car wash, the machine and car wash must interact to let it know where it is and when to do certain things
		- message passing
			- send/receive
		- shared memory
			- read/assign to variable or memory location
- Problems with the granny example of one set of needles:
	- DEADLOCK: each granny takes a needle and waits indefinitely until the other one has freed the one she has
	- LIVELOCK: Each granny takes a needle, sees the other granny has the other needle and returns it, repeats indefinitely
		- Infinite Loop, instructions being executed, system isn't making any progress (neither granny gets two needles)
	- STARVATION: One of the grannies always takes the needle before the other one
	- There are other concurrency problems that can arise, but these are the most common
		- Synchronization include other problems (ferry problem)
-	thread.start() <- 1 

	thread.start() <- 2

	We don't know which thread will run first, thread.start just spawns thread, scheduler will decide which runs first
-	SEE l2ex1.groovy
	- Any combination is possible so long as A comes before B and C comes before D because of context switching between threads and scheduling
	- m are num instructions in first thread
	  n are num instructions in second thread
	  # of possible interleavings of instructions:
	  (m+n)!    m+n
	  -----  =  
	  m!n!       m
	- Synchronization: making sure it prints ABCD (use semaphores)
- Transition Systems
	- (s, ->, I)
		- S is a set of states
		- -> C_ SxS is a transition relation
		- I C_ S set of initial states
	- See transition ex1, ex2, ex3, and ex4 on ipad l2
	- for more code see l2ex3
